We had a great time at Red Rock Canyon Adventure Park in Hinton Oklahoma.
The campground was situated in a beautiful canyon with a creek running through it.
Halden and Bobby enjoyed "frogging" (catching frogs) in the creek.
There was also a few lovely playgrounds the kids enjoyed.
The park had a lot of great hiking trails which we thoroughly enjoyed.

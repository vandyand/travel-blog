We really enjoyed our time at Jekyll Island GA! We visited the historic distric on our last day there. The district was on the in-land side of the island where there is an old port which was used exclusively before a bridge was built. The old homes and hotel here were fantastic! The Jekyll Island Authority is an organization charged with several administrative functions on the island including taking care of these historic sites. Our family really enjoyed walking the grounds and seeing the sights.

This was an interesting decorative coat of arms in a courtyard at one of the estates. Thought it looked interesting!

This "cottage" was designed by a successful architect who speciallized in bridge design. The attic of the house is designed like a suspension bridge which the second story "hangs" from.

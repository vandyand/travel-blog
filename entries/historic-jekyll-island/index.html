          Our trip to Jekyll Island, GA, was really special. On our last day, we
          checked out the historic district. It was great to see some of the
          history of this place. This area was on the in-land side of the
          island. It was the only access point to the island originally before
          the land bridge was built. The old houses and hotel have a unique
          charm that was fun to experience.

              The Jekyll Island Hotel really caught our eye. It looked fancy and
              pretty, showing off how rich the island's history is. We were
              totally drawn to it and would love to stay there someday.

              We were charmed by this home which was designed by a renowned
              bridge architect from New York. The attic's design mimics a
              suspension bridge, which the whole second story "hangs" from.

              There were several beautiful water features throughout the
              historic district. We thought this one was especially pretty,
              nestled neatly in a courtyard.

              We found this intriguing coat of arms in another courtyard of one

              The spanish moss was enchanting. The old moss-draped oaks created

          Saying goodbye to Jekyll Island, we're taking home some unforgettable
          memories. Thanks to the efforts of the Jekyll Island Authority to keep
          these historic places intact, we got a real taste of what life was
          like back in the day. This island isn't just a place to visit; it
          tells a story of American history, natural beauty, and some really
          cool old buildings, all mixed together. Oh, and did I mention we saw a
          dolphin?

We really enjoyed our time at Indian Mountain State Park in Jellico TN. The kids enjoyed playing on the multiple play grounds and there were several very nice walking trails through the park and surrounding woods. The park was right at the foot of Indian Mountain which was a scenic repreave from our flat native Michigan. Several mornings we had dense fog which was very beautiful when the sun rose behind it.

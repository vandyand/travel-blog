We visited beautiful Providence Canyon State Park in southwest Georgia. The trail consisted parcially of a stream bed with fascinating designs left by the water. There were also several "caves" in the sides of the canyon walls that the kids enjoyed exploring. We found clay and sand of many colors including white, red, orange, yellow, purple and pink. It was surprising to us to find so many different colors in one spot.

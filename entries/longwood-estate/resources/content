We really enjoyed our time at longwood estate. It is the largest octagonal house in the United States. Construction was started in 1860 but never completed because of the Civil War.

The basement is the only part of the house that was fully completed. The house was constructed for Haller Nutt who was a wealthy cotton baron. Sadly Nutt died of pneumonia in 1864. During the Civil War the confederates burned up all their cotton to prevent the union from confiscating it. His widowed wife Julia lived in the unfinished house for three decades after the war ended. In all they had 11 children, 8 of which survived to adulthood.
